# Mission_to_Mars_Challenge

**Purpose**

The Purpose of this challenge was to scrape Mars hemispheres using the url: https://marshemispheres.com/. A new webpage was created using HTML and CSS elements. Scraping was achieved via flask app and integration with Mongo DB to store the scraping data within a database named "mars_app". The webpage also had to be responsive to different devices, which was tested using the DevTools. Mars hemispheres images were added at the bottom of the webpage in the form of thumbnails. BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres along with the titles of those images and the web application was used to display the data, and the design of the web app was altered to accommodate these images.
